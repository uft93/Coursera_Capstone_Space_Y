# Coursera_Capstone_Space_Y
Hello and welcome to my final project for the IBM Data Science Specialization.

In this project, I aimed to assume the role of a data scientist for an imaginary competitor (SpaceY) of SpaceX. SpaceX quotes one launch at around $65 million, whereas its competitors quote north of $160 million for a single rocket launch. SpaceX can undercut many of its competitors because they can use the first stage of their rockets. If I can predict the possibility of success of a SpaceX launch, my imaginary company would be able to make data-driven decisions when bidding against SpaceX.

My tasks were:

- Get the SpaceX launch data from the SpaceX REST API and SpaceX launch Wiki page
- Format and label the data correctly
- Do EDA through SQL queries and data viz
- Create geospatial visualizations on Folium maps
- Create dashboards using Plotly Dash
- Use sklearn's supervised learning algorithms to build different classifiers to predict the outcome of a launch
- Pick the best classifier for the job
- Present my finding to help my stakeholders make data-driven decisions
